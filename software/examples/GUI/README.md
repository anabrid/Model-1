 hc_gui.pl and its associated configuration file hc_gui.yml implement a simple
GUI which can be used to control a basic Model-1 analog/hybrid computer.

 It requires the following Perl-modules:

Wx
Wx::Frame
Wx::Event
IO::HyCon

 Since the Wx-packages are sometimes a bit fiddly to install, it is recommended
to use the Citrus-Perl distribution which already includes these packages.
